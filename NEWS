Package: BiocParallel.FutureParam
=================================

Version: 0.2.0-9000 [2019-12-16]

BUG FIXES:

 * bplapply() and bpiterate() for FutureParam now uses value() instead of
   values(), which is deprecated in future (>= 1.20.0).
   

Version: 0.2.0 [2019-07-21]

BUG FIXES:

 * FutureParam did not work in Bioconductor (>= 3.8) due to updates in
   the BiocParallel package.

 * Argument 'catch.errors' for FutureParam is now defunct and hidden.
 

Version: 0.1.1 [2017-07-09]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: Now testing FutureParam with all built-in strategies of the future
   package as well as the 'local' and 'interactive' strategies of
   future.batchtools and future.BatchJobs.  In order to test with the latter
   two, those packages need to be installed.
