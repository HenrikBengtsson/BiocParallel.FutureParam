BUG FIXES:

   are now part of Bioconductor (>= 3.9).


Version: 0.1.1 [2017-07-09]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTS: Now testing FutureParam with all built-in strategies of the future
   package as well as the 'local' and 'interactive' strategies of
   future.batchtools and future.BatchJobs.  In order to test with the latter
   two, those packages need to be installed.
